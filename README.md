## Setup
Because this is an extension, prior to publication on the Chrome webstore, users need to do a teeny bit of work to view the extension for themselves (as opposed to having an already-hosted web application).
* First, make sure to clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-20S/project-2-many-tabz.git` in a directory of your choice. 
* Next, simply fire up Chrome and navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/). 
* Ensure Developer Mode is activated (click the radio button at the top right of this page).
* Click the Load Unpacked button, and select the /src folder of this github repository.
* Turn on the extension by clicking the blue radio button at the bottom right corner of the extension box.
* Click the refresh icon on the extension box anytime you pull a new update from this repository.

## Deployment
Once you've finished the above, just click the new 2ManyTabs icon in your chrome window to pull up our beauiful UI and interact with the app!
